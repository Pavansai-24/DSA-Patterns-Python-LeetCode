## 📈 Progress

### ✅ Overall
- Total LeetCode Problems Solved: **~300**
- Focus: **Pattern-based learning**
- Consistent problem solving & clean code documentation

### ✅ High Confidence Areas
- Arrays  
- Hashing  
- Strings  
- Math  
- Binary Search  

### 🟡 Moderate Confidence
- Dynamic Programming (Top-Down)
